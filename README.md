# metagit

Yet another tool to manage multiple git repositories.

## Usage
The main purposes of metagit are:

  - Keep track of git repositories that you want to have on every machine
  - Have an overview whether there is a repository with un-commited
    changes or non-pushed commits
  - Fetch from upstream for all your repositories at once (e.g. before working
    offline for some time)

## Installation
The only dependencies are git and the python 3 standard libraries.

## Credits
The main inspiration is https://github.com/stettberger/metagit
